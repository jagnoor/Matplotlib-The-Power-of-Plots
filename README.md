Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. 


## Observations 
 1. The dataset contains data for 249 mice. 124 female and 125 male. Capomulin has maximum 230 mice on this regimen.
 2. The correlation between mouse weight, and average tumor volume is 0.84. It is a strong positive correlation, when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.
 3.  The R-squared value is 0.70, which means 70% the model fit the data, wich is fairely good to predict the data from the model
